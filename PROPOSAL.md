Web 2.0 is powerful- and with that power comes the ability to take a much deeper look into the interactions "consumers" have with their services. Cookie Monster showcases some of the data that can be extracted from a cookie, and then displaying user data. You'll be surprised how much websites can get from you.

In order to implement this project, we would make use of:
- Browser events: We can obtain specific data on user's interactions with the website, like mouse movements, current focused webpage, and much, much more. We aim to highlight just how much data can be mined off users' computers through event listeners.

- Modularity: Developers are able to obtain user-specific hardware information from simple JS queries and we wanted to include that information in Cookie Monster.

- Cookies: With cookies, we are able to assign a hash to store user information- and when you re-visit Cookie Monster, you'll be able to see how the data gathered on you persists after every reload. Scary, isn't it?

- Data Visualization: Using the data collected from the browser events, we are able to analyze how users interact with webpages on an element by element basis. This is great for Marketing, and UI/UX testing.
