# Cookie Monster
## Final Project Proposal - cs4241-a18
#### Surya Vadivazhagu (svadivazhagu) & Daniel McDonough (dmcdonough WPI, mcdonoughd GitHub)

Web 2.0 is powerful- and with that power comes the ability to take a much deeper look into the interactions "consumers" have with their services. The website Cookie Monster (https://clickclickclick.click) showcases some of the data that can be extracted from a single cookie, along with basic website data analytics. You'll be surprised how much they can get from you.

Expanding on this basis, we propose an implementation to track information on core aspects of the UI, to do live A/B Testing on 2 different web pages. These 2 pages will track the user's movements, button clicks, etc. The data is then pushed to a database and displayed on a 3rd page. 

aim to have the proposal content focused on communicating the core ideas behind the work, such as the problem the proposal is addressing, the scope of the work, the anticipated learning objectives, etc.

- revise to make the proposal as brief as possible, to better enable reviewers to spend more time reading and giving feedback on areas they have expertise in (i.e. we may not all be Vue experts, but we can comment on the problem solving strategy, scope, anticipated time to learn a framework / library, etc)
