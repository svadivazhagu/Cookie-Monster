## Project Ideation
Cookie Monster was born from the desire to understand how services like Google Analytics and others are able to gather so much information on their users. While Cookie Monster lacks the deep data-mining features of Google Analytics, it is our testament to learning about persistent web analytics within the time-frame of an academic final project.
